# Osteoarthritis Assignment
An orthopaedist is a medical doctor specializing in diagnosing and treating disorders related to the skeletal system. Part of their job is to distinguish between a healthy person and a person with Osteoarthritis by looking at their knee X-ray images.

# Osteoarthritis: 
Osteoarthritis, commonly known as wear-and-tear arthritis, is a condition in which the natural cushioning between joints -- cartilage -- wears away. When this happens, the bones of the joints rub more closely against one another with less of the shock-absorbing benefits of cartilage. The rubbing results in pain, swelling, stiffness, decreased ability to move, and sometimes the formation of bone spurs.
# Objective:

You have to create a deep learning model that can detect if osteoarthritis is present or not in a given knee X-ray image using inceptionV3(GoogleNet) architecture.

## Dataset:

The Dataset contains three folders : 

Test (845 images)

Train (2350 images)

Valid (641 images)



Each of these folders has two folders  

Test
    
    - Normal
    
    - Osteoarthritis
Train
    
    -Normal
    
    -Osteoarthritis
Valid
    
    -Normal
    
    -Osteoarthritis
## Assignment

Your task is to create a deep learning model that can provide the probability of having osteoarthritis for a given knee X-ray image using inceptionV3(GoogleNet) architecture.
